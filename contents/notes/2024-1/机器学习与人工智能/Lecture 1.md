## 5 Surpervised Learning
- Training dataset: the sample of data used to fit the Model
- Validation dataset: the sample of data used to provide an unbiased evaluation of a model fit on the training dataset while tuning model hyperparameters
- Test dataset: a set of examples used only to assess the performance of a fully spercified classifier
