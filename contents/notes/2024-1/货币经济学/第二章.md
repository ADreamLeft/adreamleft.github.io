# Diamond Setup
Continuous time with discount rate $e^{-rt}$
$r$ Time preference return interest rate
Agents has measure $\mathrm{1}$
Only one good, agents can't consume their own good.
2 sectors: Production (P) and Trade (T)
Agents in production sector has a Possion arrival rate $\alpha$ to have a chance to produce with cost $c$.
$c$ is a random variable whose cdf $F(c)$ with support $[\underset-c, \bar{c}]$
Agents find a counterpart with a possion arrival rate $\beta(N)$
$N$ is the measure of agents on $T$. such that $N$ is the measure of agents on $P$
The total measure of pairs in $T$ is $m(N)$. $\beta(N) = \frac{m(N)}{N}$
Agents get $u$ after consumption
- Constant return to scale: $\beta'(N) = 0$
- Decreasing return to scale: $\beta'(N) < 0$
- Increasing return to scale: $\beta'(N) > 0$
# Value Function
$$
\begin{aligned}
rV_{0} &= \alpha\mathbb{E}\max (V_{1}- V_{0} -c, 0)\\
	&= \alpha \int_\underline{c}^{\bar c} \max (V_{1}- V_{0} -c, 0)\mathrm d F(c)\\
	&= \alpha\int^{k}_\underline c (k-c)\mathrm dF(c)
\end{aligned}
$$
$$
\begin{aligned}
S_{0}(k)&=\int_\underline c ^{k}(k-c)\mathrm{d} F(c),S_0'(k)>0\\
rV_{0} &= \alpha S_{0}(k)
\end{aligned}
$$
$$
\begin{aligned}
rV_{1} &= \beta(N) (u+V_{0}-V_{1})\\
rV_{1} &= \beta(N) (u-k)
\end{aligned}
$$
$$
\begin{aligned}
rk &= \beta(N)(u-k) -\alpha S_{0}k\\
S(N,k) &=rk + \alpha S_{0}(k) -\beta(N)(U-k)=0
\end{aligned}
$$
$$
T(N, k)= \beta(N) N - (1- N)\alpha F(k) = 0
$$
As $m'(N) > 0$ so $T(N, k)$ is an increasing cure ($N-k$ curve)
## 1 Constant case
$\beta(N) \equiv \beta$ so $k\equiv k^*$, there is unique equilibrium
## 2 Decreasing case
$\beta'(N) <0$ so  $S(N, k)$ is also a decreasing curve
## 3 Increasing case
$S(N< k)$ is an increasing cure so there probably exist 2 or more intersections of $T$ and $S$.
- Multiple Equilibrium.
- Welfare is not always Pareto optimal.
- Expectation matters.
